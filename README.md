# Oraganic notes for JEE

Dear readers,


These are my organic chemistry notes from class 12, during my JEE preparation. These were made during class, and have not been fact checked later. Therefore, please be wary that there might be some errors, or discrepancies. 

I had minimal exposure to Chemistry in my college, having chosen to go in to Physics. However, these notes were quite helpful to me during 12. I have taken care to color coordinate different parts, and highlight essential parts. The notes are numbered IV - VII (these are a subset of all chemistry notes made during JEE), wherein the first page of each file contains the list of chapters covered (some sections may be missing or some unrelated sections may be present, but these are minimal). 

Several of my juniors found these notes helpful, so I decided to make them publicly available. Here, I would like to stress again, that there might be minor mistakes, and would like to advise you to refer these notes alongside a textbook. I hope you find these notes helpful in your preparation, or just enjoyable to go through. 

For any comments, feedback, or remark, you can write to me at shibashish.m4@gmail.com. Corrections are welcome, and I will try to update them on the files as soon as possible.


Regards,
ShibashishÂ Mahapatra
